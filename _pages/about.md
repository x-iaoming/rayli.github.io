Hi! Weclome to Ray's homepage. 

About me
------

  I grew up in Foshan, China and attended schools in Singapore on SM1 scholarship. I am studying Computer Science at Haverford College in the United States and graduating in 2021. I am also a Master's Candidate at the Univerisity of Pennsylvania through the 4+1 program. I'm currently looking for internship opportunities in summer 2021 and PhD programs in Fall 2021.

  I have worked as a machine learning reserach assistant in Dark Reactions Lab with Prof. Sorelle Friedler throughout my undergraduate. My research is on applied machine learning in predicting chemical reactions outcomes and explaining machine learning models with interpretability methods. I also spent a summer as a software engineer intern at Tripli.com building backend data pipelines for finding the best travel deals.

  At Haverford College, I am the Captain of Club Badminton team and ex Board Member of the International House. I am also a student photographer and used to be a visual designer for the Alumni Office. During my free time, I enjoy badminton, biking, traveling, and photography. I speak Mandarin, Cantonese, English, French, and Itialian, and I love learning new languages. I would describe myself as a free-spirited person who enjoys exploring new knowledge, experiences, and possibilities.
